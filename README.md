**Platform for Situated Intelligence** (or in short, \\psi, pronounced like the greek letter) is an open, extensible framework for development and research of multimodal, integrative-AI systems. These are systems that process various types of streaming sensor data (such as audio, video, depth, etc.) and that need to leverage and coordinate a variety of component technologies. Examples range from social robots or embodied agents that interact with people, to smart spaces such as instrumented meeting rooms, all the way to applications based on small devices that process streaming sensor data.

The framework alleviates the engineering challenges that arise when building such systems by providing: 
-	a modern, performant **infrastructure** for working with multimodal, temporally streaming data, and a programming paradigm for concurrent, coordinated computation that simplifies application development.
-	a set of **tools** for multimodal data visualization, annotation, and processing, which support and accelerate debugging and maintenance.
-	an ecosystem of **components** for various sensors, processing technologies, and effectors, enabling rapid prototyping and reuse.

# Getting Started

The core infrastructure in Platform for Situated Intelligence is built on .NET Standard and therefore runs both on Windows and Linux. Some [components](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/List-of-Components) and tools are more specific and are available only on one or the other operating system.

You can get started building \\psi applications in two ways:
 - [leveraging \\psi NuGet packages](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Using-via-NuGet-Packages), or
 - [cloning and building the source code](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Building-the-Codebase). 

To learn more about \\psi and how to build applications with it, we recommend you start with the [Brief Introduction](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Brief-Introduction) tutorial, which will walk you through for some of the main concepts. It shows how to create a simple program, describes the core concept of a stream, and explains how to transform, synchronize, visualize, persist and replay streams from disk.

The documentation for \\psi is available in the [github project wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki). It contains various informational resources, including [tutorials]( https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Tutorials), [samples]( https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Samples), and [other specialized topics]( https://github.com/microsoft/psi/wiki/Other-Topics) that can help you learn more about the framework.
